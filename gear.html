    <p>For you all asking about dice, this is a thing that will change according to the systemm if you want to play shadowrun you will only need a bunch of d6(six sided dice),
       for d&d and pathfinder you will need a dice set with a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and the d20 or more specific for the fate system you will need the fudge die(the one with the plus side and the minus side).</p>

              Ok not the mostly friendly free option but you can download the SRD (system reference document),and have the base rules to create a game around it, 
              is a good base for anyone who want to create, maybe you want to create your own world with your own gods or without them for this the SRD is a good starting point.

              Ironsworn is what I would describe as a variable fantasy tabletop roleplaying game.  I use the word variable because at the outset, you are asked to describe your own truths for the world of Ironsworn and these truths place your game somewhere along a spectrum from “grim dark” to not quite “high fantasy”.
